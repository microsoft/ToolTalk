    "scenario": "The user wants to send a message to their crush, inviting them to go out for a date. They want to check the forecast weather of their city to see if it is suitable for an outdoor activity (ForecastWeather). They also want to find out if they have any messages from their crush that they might have missed (SearchMessages). They find out that their crush has not replied to their last message, which was sent two days ago. They feel a bit discouraged, but they decide to try again. They then delete an alarm that they had set for a movie night with their friends, since they want to keep their schedule free (DeleteAlarm). They then send the message to their crush, suggesting a picnic in the park and hoping for a positive response (SendMessage).",
