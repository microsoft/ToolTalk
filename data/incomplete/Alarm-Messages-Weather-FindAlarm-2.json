They use the FindAlarms API to see all the alarms that they have set and see that they have 10 alarms in total. They use the SearchMessages API to see if any of the alarms are related to messages that they have received or sent and see that 3 of them are. They use the DeleteAlarm API to delete the 3 alarms that are related to messages. They use the HistoricWeather API to see if any of the alarms are related to weather events that they were interested in and see that 2 of them are. They use the DeleteAlarm API to delete the 2 alarms that are related to weather events.",
